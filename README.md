**Business Transformation Case — Fintech Operating Model Redesign**
#
**Overview**:

This project is an internal strategy simulation evaluating how a mid-size fintech company can restore profitable growth by realigning its operating model with customer economic value.

The analysis focuses on customer segmentation, cost-to-serve dynamics, and operating model tradeoffs to identify transformation initiatives that deliver sustainable margin improvement without relying solely on efficiency gains.
#
**Problem Statement**:

Despite strong user growth, the business experienced slowing profitability driven by:

• High cost-to-serve across low-value customer segments

• Uniform support and operating models applied to economically different customers

• Limited visibility into contribution by segment

Leadership requested a structured assessment to identify where value is created, where costs are misaligned, and what transformation levers would have the greatest impact over a 12–18 month horizon.
#
**Approach**:

• The analysis followed a strategy & operations framework commonly used by internal consulting and transformation teams:

**1. Baseline Economics**

• Analyzed revenue, support costs, and contribution by customer segment

**2. Cost Structure Review**

• Assessed operating costs and cost-to-serve drivers

**3. Scenario Modeling**

• Compared a base case against automation-only and segment-focused operating models

**4. Insight Development**

• Identified structural misalignment between scale, value, and operating effort

**5. Transformation Design**

• Developed focused initiatives and a phased execution roadmap

The model is directional and decision-oriented, designed to support leadership judgment rather than accounting precision.
#
**Key Insights**:

• Customer value is highly concentrated, while operating effort is broadly distributed

• Cost-to-serve is misaligned with economic contribution across segments

• Automation improves margins but does not materially change growth composition

• Segment-focused operating models deliver outsized impact relative to efficiency alone
#
**Recommended Initiatives**

Segment-Based Operating Model — Align service levels and workflows to customer value

Targeted Support Automation — Reduce cost-to-serve for low-complexity interactions

High-Value Segment Growth Focus — Prioritize SMB and Enterprise contribution

KPI Ownership & Operating Cadence Redesign — Enable sustained execution and accountability
#
**Execution Roadmap**:

A phased 12–18 month roadmap sequences initiatives to limit risk, enable learning, and sustain impact.

• 0–3 months: Stabilize & diagnose

• 3–6 months: Enable & pilot

• 6–12 months: Scale & reallocate

• 12–18 months: Optimize & sustain

**Notes**

This project was developed as an independent strategy & operations case study to demonstrate structured problem-solving, analytical judgment, and executive-level communication.
